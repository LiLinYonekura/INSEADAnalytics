We will use the [Boats case](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/Boats-A-prerelease.pdf) data. 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE, error = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', tidy=TRUE}
#Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk to allow printing of the R code that generated the plot.

source("../R/library.R")

# Load the data
# Code in the report file can be set to over-ride the code in the RunStudy.R file.
ProjectData = read.csv("../Data/Boats.csv", sep=";", dec=",", header=TRUE)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
